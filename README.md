# ComfortLoop💗

## Basic Details
ComfortLoop is an interactive emotional reflection system designed to reduce loneliness by creating a responsive emotional presence.
When a user expresses a feeling like “I feel lonely,” the app detects the emotion using keyword-based analysis.
It then activates a visual comfort mode where the user’s avatar is joined by a supportive figure.

### Project Description
ComfortLoop is an interactive emotional reflection app that provides visual and conversational comfort to users feeling lonely or emotionally overwhelmed. It combines avatar-based animations with empathetic responses to create a supportive digital presence.

### The Problem statement
Many people experience loneliness and emotional distress, but when they reach out, they often face silence, delayed replies, or unhelpful responses. This lack of immediate emotional support can intensify feelings of isolation.

### The Solution
ComfortLoop 2.0 detects emotional keywords and activates a responsive comfort mode with reflective messages and visual support animations. It keeps users engaged through interactive prompts while also encouraging real-world support when needed.

This video demonstrates the core features and user experience of the ComfortLoop app.
It begins with the user launching the app and entering their name, followed by selecting an avatar and navigating to the mood screen.
The video shows how the system detects emotions from the user’s text input and transitions into the interactive comfort loop.
When the user types an emotional phrase (like “I feel lonely”), the app displays the avatar alongside a comforting figure with gentle animations.
The app responds with empathetic and reflective messages, offering interaction options such as continuing the conversation or reframing thoughts.
You can see how the interface reacts visually and textually, strengthening the sense of emotional presence rather than simple replies.
The demo also highlights technical flow, smooth state transitions, and how user choices influence the dialogue path.
